    <h1>Research Experience and Future Work</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Daru Lab:</strong> Since September of 2023, I have been a part-time undergraduate researcher working with Dr. Barnabas Daru as a part of the Daru Lab, working on computational biogeography.
      In December 2023, I was selected to attend the Biogeography R workshop in New Orleans, developing key domain-specific research skills. 
      During Summer 2024, I was a part of the Biology Summer Undergraduate Research Program (BSURP) cohort, where I began a project examining
      crop wild relatives. Namely, I helped to develop an algorithm which for a particular species, finds between 10 and 20 of its closest 
      monophyletically-clustered relatives. We are aiming for publication in Late 2025.</p>

    <p><strong>STAIR Lab:</strong> In February 2025, I was awarded a CURIS Fellowship, and was matched with the STAIR Lab working with Brando Miranda and Dr. Sanmi Koyejo.
      We are working on a project focused on LLM translation of code to formal languages, and establishing a benchmark dataset. I have started work with the lab
      and will be joining full-time in June 2025 as part of the CURIS program.</p>

    <p><strong>Research Aspirations:</strong> In the future, I intend to work in Geospatial AI research, blending theory with action to solve real-world problems. I hope to zero-in on
      biodiversity, conservation, and land use problems using these methods.</p>
